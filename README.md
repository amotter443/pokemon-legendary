>Intro ML project using binomial classification to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary or not

The [Pokémon dataset](https://gist.github.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6) is an encyclopedia of all the Pokémon across generations, containing information about the stats of each Pokémon. This project was created to teach a group of high school students about data science fundamentals using topical and interesting data. Using this data, the students created models to determine whether Pokémon were legendary or not. If after getting your bearings with basic data science modeling principles you find yourself asking "what's next?" this is the repo for you. 


Who is this project for?
------------------------
- Beginner data scientists looking to apply several models to a classification problem
- Early analytics/data science students looking to dip their toes into deep learning
- Data science educators looking for foundational projects to teach their students
- A "next-step" project after simple projects like housing or MNist digit that requires limited research to get acclimated with


Usage
--------
- Read `pokemon.csv` into your environment



Extension Options 
-----------------
- This project is a rather simplistic design
